Watch on YouTube at first.

This simulate life forms in virtual world.

There are two species in the world. The black is predator and the green is prey.
Each of them has a gene and program that defines how they control their body.
When approached to a certain distance, the prey will be eaten and the predator will multiply.
After a period of time, the prey will multiply and the predator will die.
That's what the world is.

It has nothing to do with Deep Learning or genetic algorithm or anything else.
It's just simple algorithm and you can see what happens in the simple world.

As a result, after some night of experience, they didn't show any smartness.
But it may not apply to you.

## How to run
File name | Content
--- | ---
Evolution3d.bin.zip | XNA Game Framework version. You need to install XNA Framework.
Evolution3d.bin.mono.zip | MonoGame version. It looks a little glithy, but it would just run.
